fbk_utils
=========

fbk_utils, a repository of general-purpose Facebook utilities. I write these 
types of utilites, mostly in Python, to fulfill a particular need, and only 
sparingly do I use them. They can be somewhat useful, and while they are 
horribly un-documented, I am aiming to change a lot of this by publishing it 
publicly.

For this public release, I'm releasing all code under an MIT license, that isl
do whatever you would like to with the code, including using it for commercial 
purposes, but I will not be responsible for damages.

* fbk_sanitize.py
* fbk_sanitize_3.py
